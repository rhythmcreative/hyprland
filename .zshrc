# This is a placeholder for your custom .zshrc configuration.
# The install.sh script will copy this file to ~/.zshrc
#
# Please replace the contents of this file with your own personalized .zshrc
# configuration.
#
# A basic example:
#
# If you use oh-my-zsh:
# export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"
# ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
# plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
# source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
#
# Or a simpler setup:
# HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history
# HISTSIZE=10000
# SAVEHIST=10000
#
# # Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
# # Set name of the theme to load --- see https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
# # ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
#
# # Add plugins in here
# # plugins=(git)
#
# # source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
#
# # Custom aliases
# alias ll='ls -alF'
# alias la='ls -A'
# alias l='ls -CF'
